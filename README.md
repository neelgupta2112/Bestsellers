Messing around w bestsellers
The goal of this project is to learn what we can about the past x amount of years of literary history through looking at bestseller data. 
Has genre makeup changed in the top books?
Has the author gender share changed over time?
Can we understand when modern genre categories began to emerge in the data?

The code pulls off of the NYT API -- which requires a sign up for their API key. The rest of the code should work, user agnostic.
